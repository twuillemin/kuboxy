# Introduction
Kuboxy (KUBernetes rOXY) is a software proxy that allows a user to connect to multiple Kubernetes cluster from a single 
server.

Kuboxy offers also several interesting features:

  * Classical REST endpoints for accessing all object (JSON format)
  * Swagger interface with all objects fully documented
  * Interface WebSocket for receiving events from the clusters
  * Kuboxy con also be itself hosted in a Kubernetes cluster
  * The JSON schemas of the Kubernetes objects are provided

# Usage

```bash
go run cmd/main.go [parameters]
```

or for building the application

```bash
go build -o kuboxy.exe cmd/main.go
./kuboxy.exe [parameters]
```

# Configuration

## Options
Options are the following:

| Name | Usage | Default Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| configurationFilePtr | Indicates a YAML/JSON file defining all the following parameters | ~/.kuboxy/application.config | ```./kuboxy.exe -configurationFilePtr="~/.kuboxy/config.json"``` |
| address | The IP address used by the service | 127.0.0.1| ```./kuboxy.exe -address=192.168.1.1``` |   
| restPort | The IP port used by the service for REST endpoints | 8080 | ```./kuboxy.exe -restPort=8080``` |
| webSocketPort | The IP port used by the event service | 8081 | ```./kuboxy.exe -webSocketPort=8081``` |
| certificateFileName | The certificate used for providing HTTPS connections | _none_  | ```./kuboxy.exe -certificateFileName="~/.kuboxy/cert.pem"``` |
| privateKeyFileName | The private key of the certificate | _none_  | ```./kuboxy.exe -privateKeyFileName="~/.kuboxy/key.pem"``` |
| kubeContextConfigurationFile | The file storing the credentials of the clusters | ~/.kuboxy/kube.config | ```./kuboxy.exe -kubeContextConfigurationFile="~/.kuboxy/kube.config"``` |

The options, save for ```configurationFilePtr``` can be defined permanently in a YAML file (JSON file is also 
acceptable as it is a subset of YAML). The equivalent of the above example are:

```yaml
address: "192.168.1.1", 
restPort: 8080,
webSocketPort: 8081, 
certificateFileName: "~/.kuboxy/cert.pem",
privateKeyFileName: "~/.kuboxy/key.pem",
kubeContextConfigurationFile: "~/.kuboxy/kube.config"
```

or

```json
{
  "address": "192.168.1.1", 
  "restPort": 8080,
  "webSocketPort": 8081, 
  "certificateFileName": "~/.kuboxy/cert.pem",
  "privateKeyFileName": "~/.kuboxy/key.pem",
  "kubeContextConfigurationFile": "~/.kuboxy/kube.config"
}
```

By default the configuration is located in ```~/.kuboxy/application.config```.

## Order of evaluations
The options are evaluated in the following order:

  1) The default values
  2) The default configuration file (```~/.kuboxy/application.config```) is loaded and its values override the default values
  3) If a specific configuration file (option ```configurationFilePtr```) is given, it is loaded and its values override the existing ones
  4) The parameters given on the command line override the existing values

Although it may seems a bit convoluted, it is not necessary to use all possibilities. In production use, defining 
everything in ```~/.kuboxy/application.config```.

# REST API
All the endpoints are available: https://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html. The endpoints are grouped by families:

 * Configuration
 * Labels
 * Objects at the cluster level
 * Objects at the namespace level
 * Search and summary
 
## Configuration endpoints
The configuration endpoints allows to configure the application, more precisely the cluster referenced by the *Cuboxy*. 
As by Kubernetes standards, the following information can be configured:

 * The cluster: name, server, certificate
 * The user: name, certificate or password
 * The context: name, cluster and user with an optional namespace
 
## Labels
This single endpoint allows to retrieve easily all the labels and their possible values for context/namespace. 

## Objects at the cluster level
These endpoints allows CRUD operations on the following objects:

 * clusterRoleBindings
 * clusterRoles
 * namespaces
 * nodeMetricses
 * nodes
 * persistentVolumes
 * storageClasses
 
## Objects at the namespace level
These endpoints allows CRUD operations on the following objects:

 * configMaps
 * cronJobs
 * daemonSets
 * deployments
 * jobs
 * networkPolicies
 * persistentVolumeClaims
 * podMetricses
 * pods
 * replicaSets
 * replicationControllers
 * roleBindings
 * roles
 * secrets
 * serviceAccounts
 * services
 * statefulSets
 
## Search and summary
This two endpoints allows to easily search objects in a cluster and to generate a high level overview of state of the 
cluster

# WebSocket events
It is possible for a client to subscribe to a context events. The subscription is running over a WebSocket connection, 
so once the chanel is open, a client can't manage its subscription and receive events without further connection.

The process is the following:
 
 1) The client connect to the WebSocket (by default https://localhost:8081/api/v1/events/)
 2) The client send a request for subscribing/unsubscribing to event. Requests are defined here after
 3) As soon as change (new/update/delete) is done in the cluster about an object, the client will receive the object 
 over the WebSocket
 
The command object has the following structure:
 
```json
{
  "command": "The command",
  "objectType": "The type of object (optional)",
  "contextName": "The name of the context (optional)",
  "namespaceName": "The namespace (optional)"
}
```

The command sent by the client is one of the following:

 * "AddSource": For subscribing a new source of event.
 * "RemoveSource": For unsubscribing to an existing source.
 * "RemoveAllSources": For unsubscribing to ... all sources.
 
# Generating documentation

## Generating Swagger documentation 
Swagger/swaggo are using a definition located at `docs/docs.go`. This documentation is not generated automatically at
the compilation time. So in case of changes in the API, it is necessary to regenerate this file with the following
procedure:
  
  1) Install, if needed, Swaggo : `go get github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag` that will generate a _swag_ executable
  2) Run `swag init` in the root of the project
  3) In the folder _docs_ of the project, run `update_docs.go`

## Generating the JSON schemas
The documentation also includes the JSON schemas for the various object managed by the application. This schemas are
located in the folder `docs/json_schemas`. Although not directly used by the application, the may be used by the client.
For generating the schemas, run the file `generator.go` located in `tools/json_schema`.
